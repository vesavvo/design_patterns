# Assignment: Fibonacci Sequence Generator

**Goal:**

Your task is to design and implement a Fibonacci sequence generator using the Iterator design pattern in Java. A Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 1 and 1. That means the first few numbers in the sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on.

This exercise will help you understand how to apply the Iterator pattern to provide a simple way to access a sequential, computed series without exposing its underlying representation.

>In this assignment, we will focus on applying the Iterator design pattern. Typically used with collections, in this exercise, the Fibonacci sequence acts as a "pseudo-collection" or more accurately, a computed sequence. By renaming Aggregate to Sequence and implementing a specific FibonacciSequence class, we emphasize that the Iterator pattern is equally useful for traversing computed sequences, not just static collections. Our goal is to explore how the Iterator pattern can abstract the iteration logic from the data generation logic, which is particularly useful for sequences where elements are computed on the fly.

**Guidelines:**

You will create three classes and an interface to manage the generation and iteration of the Fibonacci sequence:
1. **Sequence Interface**: An interface that declares a method for creating an iterator. It should declare a method `iterator()` that returns an instance of `Iterator<Integer>`.
2. **FibonacciSequence Class**: This class will implement the Sequence interface and will be responsible for generating Fibonacci numbers. It does not have to store the numbers but generate them on demand. This class should have a method to generate the next Fibonacci number when requested by the iterator.
3. **FibonacciIterator Class**: This class will implement the `java.util.Iterator<Integer>` interface. It should handle the logic for iterating over the Fibonacci sequence.
4. **Main Class**: A simple class to demonstrate the functionality of your Fibonacci sequence generator. In your `Main` class, demonstrate the use of the Fibonacci sequence generator by iterating through and printing the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

The assignment involves some critical thinking. Reflect on and decide where to maintain the state of the Fibonacci sequence calculation â€” within the **FibonacciSequence** class or within the **FibonacciIterator** class. Consider the implications of each choice regarding independence and potential sharing of state across multiple iterators. Document your decision and rationale in your code as comments.

Your Fibonacci sequence generator should be capable of producing a set number of elements (e.g., the first 10 numbers) or potentially generating an infinite sequence, limited only by system capabilities or a specified stop condition managed by the client code.
