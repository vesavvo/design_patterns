# Assignment: Calendar Adapter

**Goal:**

Develop a Java adapter that interfaces the `java.util.Calendar` class with a new interface, `NewDateInterface`, which defines methods for setting and getting the day, month, and year. Additionally, include a method `getTime()` in the interface that returns the date in the format "dd.MM.yyyy".

That interface is the one that the client code is going to use, and your adapter class should implement it, and make use of the `Calendar` class internally.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Implement `NewDateInterface`**: Define the interface with the following methods:
    - `void setDay(int day)`
    - `void setMonth(int month)`
    - `void setYear(int year)`
    - `int getDay()`
    - `int getMonth()`
    - `int getYear()`
    - `void advanceDays(int days)`

2. **Create `CalendarToNewDateAdapter`**: This class will implement `NewDateInterface`, using a `Calendar` instance internally to handle date operations.

3. **Test the Adapter**: In the `Main` class that acts as the client code, demonstrate the functionality of the adapter by creating an instance of `CalendarToNewDateAdapter`, setting the date, advancing the date with a given number of days, and printing the new date.
