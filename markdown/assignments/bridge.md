# Assignment: Extending a Bridge pattern implementation 

**Goal:**

Your goal is to select a bridge pattern implementation published on the web and extend it with additional functionality.

>As an example, at the Refactoring Guru website, there is a Java example on a system with devices and remotes. The example is available at [https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge/java/example](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge/java/example).
If you chose that example, you could extend it by adding a new device and/or a new remote. For example, you could add a new device called `SmartTV` and a new remote called `SmartRemote`. The `SmartTV` could have a method `browseInternet` and the `SmartRemote` could have a method `voiceControl`.

Note that for this assignment, you return a pdf report instead of a GitHub link.

**Guidelines:**

Your pdf report should contain the following sections:

1. **Introduction:** A brief introduction to the bridge pattern and the selected implementation. Provide a link to the original implementation and describe how the Bridge pattern is used in the implementation.

2. **New Functionality:** Describe the new functionality you added to the implementation. Explain the motivation behind the new functionality.

3. **Implementation:** Provide the code for the new functionality. You should include the new classes and methods you added to the implementation.

4. **Verification:** Describe how you verified that the new functionality works as expected. You can provide code snippets, screenshots, or any other relevant information.

5. **Conclusion:** Summarize the work done and the results obtained. Discuss any design decisions you had to make and any alternative options you considered.
